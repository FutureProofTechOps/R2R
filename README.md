<img src="./docs/pages/r2r.png" alt="Sciphi Framework">
R2R was conceived to bridge the gap between experimental RAG models and robust, production-ready systems. Our semi-opinionated framework cuts through the complexity, offering a straightforward path to deploy, adapt, and maintain RAG pipelines in production. We prioritize simplicity and practicality, aiming to set a new industry benchmark for ease of use and effectiveness.

## Demo(s)

Using cloud application to deploy the pre-built basic pipeline:
https://www.loom.com/share/e3b934b554484787b005702ced650ac9

Note - the example above uses [SciPhi Cloud](https://app.sciphi.ai) to pair with the R2R framework for observability and optimization. We intend on launching a self-hosted version of the cloud framework as our codebase matures.

### Quick Install:

**Install R2R directly using `pip`:**

```bash
# use the `'r2r[all]'` to download all required deps
pip install 'r2r[parsing,eval]'

# setup env 
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export LOCAL_DB_PATH=local.sqlite

# OR do `vim .env.example && cp .env.example .env`
# INCLUDE secrets and modify config.json
# if using cloud providers (e.g. pgvector, supabase, ...)
```

### Full Install:

For a full installation, which is recommended for development, please refer to the [relevant documentation](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/getting-started/full-install).

## Key Features

- **üöÄ Deploy**: production-ready RAG pipelines with streaming in seconds
- **üß© Customize**: your pipeline using intuitive configuration files
- **üîå Extend**: your pipeline logic with code
- **‚öñÔ∏è Autoscale**: your pipeline in the cloud with [SciPhi](https://app.sciphi.ai/) 
- **ü§ñ OSS **: framework built for and by the OSS community to make RAG easier.

## Examples

The project includes several examples that demonstrate application deployment and interaction:

### Servers

1. [`basic_pipeline.py`](r2r/examples/servers/basic_pipeline.py): This example runs the backend server with the basic RAG pipeline, which includes the ingestion, embedding, and RAG pipelines served via FastAPI.

   ```bash
   python -m r2r.examples.servers.basic_pipeline
   ```

2. [`synthetic_query_pipeline.py`](r2r/examples/servers/synthetic_query_pipeline.py): This example demonstrates a more advanced pipeline that generates synthetic queries to improve the RAG pipeline's performance.

   ```bash
   python -m r2r.examples.servers.synthetic_query_pipeline
   ```

3. [`reducto_pipeline.py`](r2r/examples/servers/reducto_pipeline.py): This example showcases the integration of the Reducto adapter for PDF ingestion.

   ```bash
   python -m r2r.examples.servers.reducto_pipeline
   ```

4. [`web_search_pipeline.py`](r2r/examples/servers/web_search_pipeline.py): This example demonstrates the usage of the `WebSearchRAGPipeline` for web search capabilities.

   ```bash
   python -m r2r.examples.servers.web_search_pipeline
   ```

### Clients

1. [`run_basic_client.py`](r2r/examples/clients/run_basic_client.py): This example should be run after starting the basic pipeline server. It demonstrates uploading text entries and a PDF to the local server using the Python client. It also showcases document and user-level vector management with built-in features.

   ```bash
   python -m r2r.examples.clients.run_basic_client
   ```

2. [`run_basic_client_ext.py`](r2r/examples/clients/run_basic_client_ext.py): This example extends the basic client functionality and provides a more interactive experience for uploading and querying documents.

   ```bash
   python -m r2r.examples.clients.run_basic_client_ext
   ```

3. [`run_synthetic_query_client.py`](r2r/examples/clients/run_synthetic_query_client.py): This example is optimized for interaction with the synthetic query pipeline server, showcasing the enhanced RAG pipeline's capabilities.

   ```bash
   python -m r2r.examples.clients.run_synthetic_query_client
   ```

## Core Abstractions

The framework primarily revolves around three core abstractions:

- The **Ingestion Pipeline**: Facilitates the preparation of embeddable 'Documents' from various data formats (json, txt, pdf, html, etc.). The abstraction can be found in [`ingestion.py`](r2r/core/pipelines/ingestion.py) and relevant documentation is available [here](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/core-features/ingestion).

- The **Embedding Pipeline**: Manages the transformation of text into stored vector embeddings, interacting with embedding and vector database providers through a series of steps (e.g., extract_text, transform_text, chunk_text, embed_chunks, etc.). The abstraction can be found in [`embedding.py`](r2r/core/pipelines/embedding.py) and relevant documentation is available [here](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/core-features/embedding).

- The **RAG Pipeline**: Works similarly to the embedding pipeline but incorporates an LLM provider to produce text completions. The abstraction can be found in [`rag.py`](r2r/core/pipelines/rag.py) and relevant documentation is available [here](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/core-features/rag).

- The **Eval Pipeline**: Samples some subset of rag_completion calls for evaluation. Currently [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) is supported. The abstraction can be found in [`eval.py`](r2r/core/pipelines/eval.py) and relevant documentation is available [here](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/core-features/eval).

Each pipeline incorporates a logging database for operation tracking and observability.
