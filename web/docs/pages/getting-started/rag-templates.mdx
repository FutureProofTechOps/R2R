## R2R Pipeline Templates

This repository contains a collection of templates for deploying Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using the R2R framework with the SciPhi cloud platform. Each template provides a starting point for building RAG pipelines with different capabilities and configurations.

## Available Templates

1. **Basic RAG** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-basic-rag-template))

   - A basic RAG pipeline template that serves as a foundation for building more complex pipelines.
   - Utilizes the R2R framework and integrates with the SciPhi cloud platform for deployment.
   - Provides configuration options for vector database provider, evaluation settings, embedding settings, text splitter settings, and language model provider.
   - Includes a `config.json` file for easy customization of deployment settings.

2. **Synthetic Queries** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-synthetic-queries-template))

   - An extension of the basic RAG pipeline that incorporates synthetic query generation capabilities.
   - Modifies the `SyntheticRAGPipeline` to return search results and completion.
   - Allows for generating synthetic queries based on the initial user query to retrieve relevant information.
   - Provides additional configuration options specific to synthetic query generation.

3. **Web RAG** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-web-rag-template))
   - An intermediate RAG pipeline template that extends the functionality of the basic RAG pipeline by incorporating web search capabilities.
   - Integrates with the SerperClient to perform web searches and retrieve relevant information.
   - Includes additional methods for query transformation, web search, and context construction.
   - Supports streaming of search results, context, and completion for real-time updates.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the templates, follow these steps:

1. Clone the desired template repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Customize the `config.json` file to configure the pipeline settings according to your requirements.
4. Implement any additional functionality or modifications specific to your use case.
5. Deploy the pipeline using the SciPhi cloud platform.

For detailed instructions and configuration options, refer to the README file within each template repository.
