## R2R Demo

The R2R demo offers a step-by-step guide on running the default R2R Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The demo ingests a list of provided documents and demonstrates search, RAG, and advanced functionality. The script at r2r/examples/demo.py, which powers the demo, can be configured and extended with sufficient developer familiarity.

## Setup

To get started with the R2R framework, follow these steps to install dependencies, set up your environment, and ingest sample documents for the demo.


### Step 0: Quick Install

First, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies and set up your environment.

```bash
# use the `'r2r[all]'` to download all possible required deps
pip install r2r

# OpenAI is the default provider and requires an API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### Step 1: Ingest Demo Files

To comprehensively demonstrate the RAG functionalities of the R2R framework, we must start by ingesting a realistic set of documents. Running the command below will parse, chunk, embed, and store a preset list of files. The included file types cover HTML, PDF, PNG, and TXT examples:

```bash
python -m r2r.examples.demo ingest_as_files
```

Time taken to ingest files: 28.49 seconds
```

**Note**

Each ingested document derives a unique `document_id` from the input file path. As the document is parsed, chunked, and embedded, this association is maintained to allow for frictionless vector database management. Additionally, a the demo includes a default `user_id` in the document metadata to facilitate user-level document management.

### Step 2: Confirm User Data

To verify the successful ingestion of the demo documents, you can fetch the metadata for the uploaded documents associated with the default demo user ID:

```bash
python -m r2r.examples.demo get_user_documents_metadata --user_id="063edaf8-3e63-4cb9-a4d6-a855f36376c3"
```

**Demo Output:**

```plaintext
...
Time taken to get user document data: 0.21 seconds
{'results': 
   [
      {
         'document_id': '327f6110-edd1-5fe3-b6b3-49b55f1cbc28',
         'title': 'pg_essay_3.html'
      }, 
      {
         'document_id': '946859f0-da5c-5db7-9b5c-c586be76d709', 
         'title': 'pg_essay_5.html'
      }, 
      {
         'document_id': '64c1c913-be06-548f-acbc-3618b00d3616', 
         'title': 'lyft_2021.pdf'
      },
      ...
   ]
}
```

## Basic Functionality

The basic functionality of the R2R framework allows you to search ingested documents and generate responses using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These steps will guide you through performing a search query, generating a RAG response, and streaming RAG results.

### Step 3: Run a Demo Search

Documents are stored by default in a local vector database. The vector database provider and settings can be specified via an input `config.json`. To

 perform a search query on the ingested user documents, use the following command:

```bash
python -m r2r.examples.demo search --query="Who was Aristotle?"
```

**Demo Output:**

```plaintext
...
Time taken to search: 0.39 seconds
{
    'id': UUID('93c44e73-8e95-50c2-84af-6a42f070b552'), 
    'score': 0.7739712385010018, 
    'metadata': 
    {
        'document_id': '15255e98-e245-5b58-a57f-6c51babf72dd', 
        'extraction_id': '5c61f9b9-b468-5fd7-8eb1-5d797a15c484', 
        'text': 'Aristotle[A] (Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης Aristotélēs, pronounced [aristotélɛːs]; 384–322 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, and the arts. As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began

the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science.', 
        'title': 'aristotle.txt',
        'user_id': '063edaf8-3e63-4cb9-a4d6-a855f36376c3', 
        'query': 'Who was Aristotle?'
    }
},
...
```

### Step 4: Run a Demo RAG Completion

To generate a response for a query using RAG, execute the following command:

```bash
python -m r2r.examples.demo rag --query="What was Ubers profit in 2020?"
```

**Demo Output:**

```plaintext
...
Time taken to run RAG: 2.29 seconds
{'results': [ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9RCB5xUbDuI1f0vPw3RUO7BWQImBN', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="Uber's profit in 2020 was a net loss of $6,768 million [10].", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1716268695, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=20, prompt_tokens=1470, total_tokens=1490))]}
```

### Step 5: Run a Demo RAG Stream

For streaming results from a RAG query, use the following command:

```bash
python -m r2r.examples.demo rag --query="What was Lyfts profit in 2020?" --streaming=true
```

**Demo Output:**

```plaintext
r2r.main.r2r_config - INFO - Loading configuration from <YOUR_WORKDIR>/config.json - 2024-05-20 22:27:31,890
...
<search>["{\"id\":\"808c47c5-ebef-504a-a230-aa9ddcfbd87 .... </search>
<completion>Lyft reported a net loss of $1,752,857,000 in 2020 according to [2]. Therefore, Lyft did not make a profit in 2020.</completion>                                                      
Time taken to stream RAG response: 2.79 seconds
```

## Document Management

Effective document management is crucial for maintaining a robust and efficient RAG system. This section guides you through various operations related to document management, including deleting documents and managing user-specific data. These steps will help ensure your document database remains organized and up-to-date.

### Delete a Specified Document

To delete a document by its ID, or any other metadata field, use the delete command. For example, to delete all chunks corresponding to the uploaded file `aristotle.txt`, we can call delete on the associated document ID with the value `15255e98-e245-5b58-a57f-6c51babf72dd`:

```bash
poetry run python -m r2r.examples.demo delete --keys="['document_id']" --values="['c9bdbac7-0ea3-5c9e-b590-018bd09b127b']"
```
By default the delete method will perform an AND operation over all given metadata keys and values.

After deleting a document, you can run a search command to verify its removal:

```bash
python -m r2r.examples.demo search --query="Who was Aristotle?"
```

**Demo Output:**

```plaintext
Time taken to search: 1.10 seconds
{'id': UUID('37993d2c-b61a-58b4-9a89-f167d59b8633'), 'score': 0.2662125334175588, 'metadata': {'document_id': '327f6110-edd1-5fe3-b6b3-49b55f1cbc28', 'extraction_id': '7293e1fc-d399-5bfe-a74a-967c2b2ce351', 'text': "completely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thought\nof the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as\nsoon as Copernicus proposed it.

...
```

**Note**

The quality of search results has dramatically decreased now that the Aristotle-specific document has been fully erased. This highlights the importance of the ingested data quality on the RAG results.

### Delete a Specified User's Documents

To delete all documents associated with a given user, run the delete command on the `user_id`.

```bash
# run the following command with care, as it will erase all ingested user data
# python -m r2r.examples.demo delete --keys="['user_id']" --values="['063edaf8-3e63-4cb9-a4d6-a855f36376c3']"
```

Afterwards, we may confirm complete user documentation through the `get_user_documents_metadata` functionality.


### Delete a Specified User's Documents

To delete all documents associated with a given user, run the delete command on the `user_id`.

```bash
# run the following command with care, as it will erase all ingested user data
# python -m r2r.examples.demo delete --keys="['user_id']" --values="['063edaf8-3e63-4cb9-a4d6-a855f36376c3']"
```

Afterwards, we may confirm complete user documentation through the `get_user_documents_metadata` functionality.

**Demo Output:**

```bash
...
Time taken to get user document data: 0.00 seconds
{'results': []}
```

## Advanced Functionality

### Demo Multi-Modal Support

An `.png` image of a desktop screen was included as part of the ingestion command shown above. By default, the `ImageParser` uses an OpenAI vision model (gpt-4o) to transcribe the image and embed that transcription. We can then search these results directly, as evidenced below:

```bash
python -m r2r.examples.demo search --query="What is shown on the user screen?"
```

**Demo Output:**

```plaintext

```

### Run LLM-Powered Evaluation

The R2R framework can evaluate the relevance and accuracy of generated responses using LLM-powered evaluation. Run the following command to perform an evaluation:

```bash
python -m r2r.examples.demo evaluate
```

**Demo Output:**

```plaintext
Time taken to evaluate: 2.42 seconds
{'results': [{'query_context_relevancy': 0.5, 'answer_grounding': 1.0}]}
```

This output is consistent with the default query, context, and answer, shown below.

```plaintext
> Query
    What is the meaning of life?
> Context
    Search Results:
        1. The meaning of life is 42.
        2. The car is red.
        3. The meaning of life is to help others.
        4. The car is blue.
        5. The meaning of life is to learn and grow.
        6. The car is green.
        7. The meaning of life is to make a difference.
        8. The car is yellow.
        9. The meaning of life is to enjoy the journey.
        10. The car is black.
> Completion
    The meaning of life is to help others, learn and grow, and to make a difference.
```

### Logging

Pipes naturally integrate with your selected logging provider. R2R pipelines for ingestion, search, and RAG create comprehensive logs that allow for total observability.

```bash
python -m r2r.examples.demo get_logs
```

**Demo Output:**

```plaintext
