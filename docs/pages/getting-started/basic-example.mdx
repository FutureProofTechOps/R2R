## Basic Example
This example demonstrates setting up a local server using the R2R framework to host a RAG pipeline, which includes ingestion, embedding, and generation processes. Following the server setup, you'll interact with it using a client to ingest PDF data, perform searches, and generate responses, showcasing the framework's capabilities for advanced document processing and retrieval-augmented generation.

## Step 0: Quick Install


```bash
# use the `'r2r[all]'` to download all possible required deps
pip install 'r2r'

export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```


## Step 1: Dry Run

Run a quick end-to-end test of the default RAG pipeline
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```
