## Full Install with `poetry`:

Full installation is largely meant to be used by developers who wish to extend the R2R framework.

1. [Install Poetry](#install-poetry): Ensure Poetry is installed.
2. [Clone and Install Dependencies](#clone-and-install-dependencies): Get the project and its dependencies.
3. [Config Setup (Optional)](#config-setup-optional): Create `.env` and `config.json`.
4. [Configure Environment Variables](#configure-environment-variables): Set up necessary `.env` configurations.

##### Install Poetry:

Poetry manages the virtual environment and dependency resolution for your project, making it compatible with both existing `Pip` and `Conda` environments.
To install poetry, visit the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for the latest package and installation instructions or run the following command.

##### Clone and Install Dependencies:

- Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:SciPhi-AI/r2r.git
  cd r2r
  ```
- Install the project dependencies with Poetry:
  ```bash
  # See pyproject.toml for available extras
  # use "all" to include every optional dependency
  poetry install -E parsing -E eval
  ```

##### Configure Environment Variables:

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and then apply your secrets. Afterwards, inspect the `config.json` and make any desired modifications.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Update your secrets
vim .env

# Modify the config.json
vim config.json
```

We have several config options to run the project locally or at the cloud. At minimum, you'll need your OpenAI key secrets in your `.env` file for the project to work properly. For a fast setup, you can get started with a local Postgres db.
