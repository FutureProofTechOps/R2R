# Running a RAG Pipeline Locally with R2R

## Step 1: Fork and Clone the R2R Basic RAG Template Repository

1. Navigate to the [R2R Basic RAG Template repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-basic-rag-template) on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
3. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/R2R-basic-rag-template.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd R2R-basic-rag-template
   ```

## Step 2: Configure the RAG Pipeline

1. Open the `config.json` file in a text editor.
2. Modify the configuration options according to your requirements. The `config.json` file allows you to specify settings such as the vector database provider, LLM settings, embedding settings, parsing logic, evaluation provider, and more.
3. Save the changes to the `config.json` file.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies and Run the Application

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```
4. The RAG pipeline endpoint will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Step 4: Interact with the RAG Pipeline

You can now interact with the locally deployed RAG pipeline using the R2R client or by sending HTTP requests to the endpoint.

Here's the modified version of the second part based on the provided README:

## Step 5: Building Your Own Application

If you want to build your own application that interacts with the RAG pipeline, you can use the [APP Basic RAG Template repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/APP-basic-rag-template) as a starting point. This repository provides a web application template that communicates with the deployed RAG pipeline.

To use the template:

1. Fork the [APP Basic RAG Template repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/APP-basic-rag-template) on GitHub.

2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/APP-basic-rag-template.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd web
   ```

4. Install the dependencies using pnpm:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This will start the application in development mode and open it in your default browser.

6. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

7. Enter the URL of your deployed RAG pipeline in the "API URL" input box at the top of the page.

8. Upload documents using the "Upload File" button in the sidebar.

9. Submit queries using the search input at the bottom of the main content area.

10. View the generated answers and source citations in the main content area.

11. To build the server:

    ```
    pnpm build
    ```

The web application template provides the following features:

- User-specific document management: Each user has their own set of uploaded documents.
- Document upload: Users can upload documents through the application interface.
- Query submission: Users can submit queries based on their uploaded documents.
- AI-generated answers: The application communicates with the deployed RAG pipeline to process the uploaded documents and generate answers to user queries.
- Source citations: The generated answers include citations to the relevant documents used to derive the answer.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.

Customize the web application according to your needs and integrate it with your locally deployed RAG pipeline.
