## Running R2R with Search Reranking

**This document extends the [R2R local RAG cookbook](/cookbooks/local-rag)** by demonstrating how R2R can be ran with reranking. Search with reranking enhances traditional search by applying additional downstream ranking powered by language models. This technique refines the results, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant outcomes.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="️⚠️">
Currently, reranking is only supported when running with local embedding models. Start with the local RAG cookbook [located here](/cookbooks/local-rag) if you have not yet!

### Running with Local Embedding and Reranking

To run R2R with local embedding and reranking, we will need to override the default `config.json` with settings like those shown in the collapsible below.

<details>
<summary>Reranking Configuration</summary>

```json filename="local_ollama_rerank.json"
{
  "embedding": {
    "provider": "sentence-transformers",
    "base_model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    "base_dimension": 384,
    "rerank_model": "jinaai/jina-reranker-v1-turbo-en",
    "rerank_dimension": 384,
    "rerank_transformer_type": "CrossEncoder",
    "batch_size": 32,
    "text_splitter": {
      "type": "recursive_character",
      "chunk_size": 512,
      "chunk_overlap": 20
    }
  }
}
```
These settings build upon those shown in `/examples/configs/local_ollama.json` and are provided by default in the config file located at `/examples/configs/local_ollama_rerank.json`.

### Executing a Basic Search

If the target database is empty, quickly populate it with sample files, which include `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.html`, and `.png` examples, using the command shown below. To replicate the exact results shown below, these commands must be run in order on a clean database.

```bash filename="bash" copy
python -m r2r.examples.quickstart ingest_as_files --config_name=local_ollama --no-media
```

Once the files are populated, run a search with the following command:

```bash filename="bash" copy
python -m r2r.examples.quickstart search --query="Who was Aristotle?" --config_name=local_ollama
```

```plaintext

  ...
  'score': '0.742869408806949',
  'text': 'Aristotle[A] (Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης Aristotélēs, pronounced [aristotélɛːs]; 384–322 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath.

As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science.',

```

### Executing a Reranked Search

Executing a reranked search is as simple as building R2R with a `config.json` which includes `rerank_model`, `rerank_dimension`, and optionally a `rerank_transformer_type`:

```bash filename="bash" copy
python -m r2r.examples.quickstart search --query="Who was Aristotle?" --config_name=local_ollama_rerank
```

```plaintext
{
  ...
  'score': '0.9439374804496765',

With the embedding and reranking model used in this cookbook, we can see a dramatic increase in the quality of returned search results.


### Summary
The reranked search in R2R significantly improves the quality and relevance of search results by adding an additional reranking step powered by language models. This process first uses traditional and semantic search methods to retrieve initial results, which are then refined using a reranking model. The reranking model evaluates the context and relevance of each result, ensuring that the most pertinent documents are prioritized. This approach leverages both the empirical strengths of traditional keyword searches and the nuanced understanding provided by modern semantic models, resulting in a highly accurate and contextually relevant search experience.
