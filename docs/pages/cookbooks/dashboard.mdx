## R2R Dashboard

R2R ships with an open-source React+Next.js dashboard to facilitate managing and interacting with deployed pipelines. You can [download the dashboard here](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Dashboard).

After downloading the dashboard, you can add deployed R2R applications for monitoring:

Navigating to the pipeline page, you will find tabs for `Documents`, `Playground`, `Logs`, and `Settings`:

### Documents
The Documents page provides an overview of the uploaded documents and their associated metadata.
