## R2R Dashboard

Developers can interact with R2R in several ways, including through our [open-source React+Next.js dashboard](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Dashboard). The dashboard is designed to give R2R developers an easy way to interface with their pipelines, reducing development and iteration time.

### Clone the R2R Dashboard and Install Dependencies

#### Install PNPM

PNPM is a fast, disk space-efficient package manager that helps you manage your project dependencies. To install PNPM, visit the [official PNPM installation page](https://pnpm.io/installation) for the latest instructions, or follow the instructions outlined below:

### Installing and Running the R2R Dashboard

1. **Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash copy
    git clone git@github.com:SciPhi-AI/R2R-Dashboard.git
    cd R2R-Dashboard
    ```

2. **Install the project dependencies using PNPM:**

    ```bash copy
    pnpm install
    ```

3. **Build and start the application for production:**

    ```bash copy
    pnpm build
    pnpm start
    ```

This will build the application on port 3000. After `pnpm start` runs successfully, the dashboard can be viewed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Deploying and Watching R2R Applications

Now that your R2R dashboard is running, you can add deployed R2R applications for monitoring. You're now ready to link to your locally deployed R2R applications. More information about deploying a local R2R application server can be found in the [Client-Server Cookbook](./client-server).

### Documents

The documents page provides an overview of the uploaded documents and their associated metadata. It also provides a place to upload new documents as well as update and delete existing documents.

### Developing with the R2R Dashboard

If you'd like to develop the R2R dashboard, you can do so by starting a development server:

1. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash copy
    pnpm dev
    ```

2. **Pre-commit checks (optional but recommended):**

    Ensure your code is properly formatted and free of linting issues before committing:

    ```bash copy
    pnpm format
    pnpm lint
    ```

By following these steps, you can set up the R2R Dashboard on your local machine and start interacting with your pipelines efficiently. For more detailed information, refer to the [project's repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Dashboard).

We hope this tool proves useful in working with the R2R answer engine, and we look forward to improving this dashboard to meet your specific needs.
