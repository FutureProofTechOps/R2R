## Running R2R with Search Reranking

Search with reranking enhances traditional search by applying additional downstream ranking powered by language models. This technique refines the results, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant outcomes.

<Callout>
Currently, reranking is only supported when running with local embedding models.
</Callout>

### Running with Local Embedding and Reranking

This guide assumes R2R is already installed and the basic local RAG cookbook [located here](/cookbooks/local_rag) has been completed. To run R2R with local embedding and reranking, override the default `config.json` with settings like those shown below:

```json filename="local_ollama_rerank.json"
{
  "embedding": {
    "provider": "sentence-transformers",
    "base_model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    "base_dimension": 384,
    "rerank_model": "jinaai/jina-reranker-v1-turbo-en",
    "rerank_dimension": 384,
    "rerank_transformer_type": "CrossEncoder",
    "batch_size": 32,
    "text_splitter": {
      "type": "recursive_character",
      "chunk_size": 512,
      "chunk_overlap": 20
    }
  }
}
```

These settings build upon those shown in `/examples/configs/local_ollama.json` and are provided by default in the config file located at `/examples/configs/local_ollama_rerank.json`.

### Executing a Basic Search

To execute a basic search, start by running the backend with the basic `local_ollama` config.

```bash filename="bash"
# cd $WORKDIR
python -m r2r.examples.servers.configurable_pipeline --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --config local_ollama
```

If the target database is empty, quickly populate it with demo files, which include `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.html`, and `.png` examples, using the command shown below. The `client_server_mode` flag specifies communication with an R2R server with the default URL of `http://localhost:8000`. To replicate the exact results shown below, these commands must be run in order on a clean database.

```bash filename="bash"
python -m r2r.examples.demo ingest_as_files --client_server_mode
```

Once the files are populated, run a search with the following command:

```bash filename="bash"
python -m r2r.examples.demo search --query="Who was Aristotle?" --client_server_mode
```

### Executing a Reranked Search

Executing a reranked search is as simple as specifying a config with a `rerank_model`, `rerank_dimension`, and optionally a `rerank_transformer_type`. We will now run with the reranking config specified at the start of this cookbook:

```bash filename="bash"
# cd $WORKDIR
python -m r2r.examples.servers.configurable_pipeline --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --config local_ollama_rerank
```

Now we can execute a search as shown:

```bash filename="bash"
python -m r2r.examples.demo search --query="Who was Aristotle?" --client_server_mode
```

```plaintext

  'score': '0.9439374804496765',

With the embedding and reranking model used in this cookbook, we can see a dramatic increase in the quality of returned search results.


### Summary
The reranked search in R2R significantly improves the quality and relevance of search results by adding an additional reranking step powered by language models. This process first uses traditional and semantic search methods to retrieve initial results, which are then refined using a reranking model. The reranking model evaluates the context and relevance of each result, ensuring that the most pertinent documents are prioritized. This approach leverages both the empirical strengths of traditional keyword searches and the nuanced understanding provided by modern semantic models, resulting in a highly accurate and contextually relevant search experience.
