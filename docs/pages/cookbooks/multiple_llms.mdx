## Running R2R with Multiple LLMs

Leveraging multiple language models (LLMs) in the R2R pipeline allows for a diverse and comprehensive approach to search and retrieval tasks. By incorporating multiple LLMs, you can benefit from the unique strengths and specializations of each model, leading to improved accuracy, relevance, and contextual understanding of the search results.

<Callout>
LLMs are selected at runtime for maximum flexibility and ease of use. Use any provider supported by [LiteLLM](https://litellm.vercel.app/).

### Running RAG with Multiple LLMs

This guide assumes R2R is already installed and the basic demo [located here](/getting-started/r2r-demo) has been completed.

#### Default (OpenAI)

If you have not completed the demo, or if your target database has been cleared, start by quickly populating it with the demo files. These example files include `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.html`, and `.png` examples, and can be ingested using the command shown below. 

```bash filename="bash"
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
python -m r2r.examples.demo ingest_as_files
```

To execute a RAG response with the default R2R settings, start by running the following:

```bash filename="bash"
python -m r2r.examples.demo rag --query="Who was Aristotle?"
```

He was born in Stagira, Chalcidice [3], and his father, Nicomachus, was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon. Aristotle\'s writings covered a wide range of subjects including natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, and the arts. He founded the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, which laid the groundwork for the development of modern science. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher" and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as "The Philosopher" [2]. He was also known for his contributions to logic, ethics, zoology, and the scientific method [4], [6]. Aristotle\'s influence extended to various fields of intellectual enterprise, including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric, and literary analysis [4]. He has been referred to as the father of logic, biology, political science, zoology, and many other disciplines [6]. Aristotle\'s work had a lasting impact, and more than 2300 years after his death, he remains one of the most influential figures in human history [9].',

#### gpt-4-turbo

The default model in the demo is `gpt-3.5-turbo` as we can see from the response above. We can readily run with any OpenAI model at runtime by simply specifying the desired model in the input RAG generation. The command below runs with `gpt-4-turbo`:

```bash filename="bash"
python -m r2r.examples.demo rag --query="Who was Aristotle?" \
--rag_generation_config='{"model":"gpt-4-turbo"}'
```

#### Anthropic

To execute a RAG response using Anthropic as a provider, include a valid API key. After doing so, you can input any supported model such as `claude-3` (`claude-3-haiku-20240307`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`) or `claude-2`.

```bash filename="bash"
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=...

python -m r2r.examples.demo rag --query="Who was Aristotle?" \
--rag_generation_config='{"model":"claude-3-haiku-20240307"}'

#### Local (ollama)

It is possible to run R2R with ollama as a model provider. See the [Local RAG](/cookbooks/local_rag) for a comprehensive walkthrough.

```bash filename="bash"
python -m r2r.examples.demo rag --query="Who was Aristotle?" \
--rag_generation_config='{"model":"ollama/llama2"}'
