## Running Hybrid Search with R2R

Hybrid search combines full-text and semantic search to deliver more comprehensive and relevant results. This technique leverages the strengths of traditional keyword-based searching and modern vector embeddings' contextual understanding. In R2R, hybrid search is implemented using SQL functions and vector operations, enabling efficient and accurate searches over large datasets.

### Running with Postgres + pgvector

This guide assumes R2R is already installed and the basic demo [located here](/getting-started/r2r-demo) has been completed.

By default, R2R ships with hybrid search enabled when using PostgreSQL and pgvector as the vector database provider. To run R2R with Postgres, override the default `config.json` with settings like those shown below:

```json filename="pgvector.json"
{
  "vector_database": {
    "provider": "pgvector",
    "collection_name": "vecs"
  }
}
```

These settings are provided by default in the config file located at `/examples/configs/pgvector.json`. In addition to selecting Postgres as a provider, set the following five Postgres-related environment variables to launch the R2R application with these settings. Execute the bash command shown below with the correct information:



```bash filename="bash" copy
export POSTGRES_USER=MY_USER
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=MY_PASSWORD
export POSTGRES_HOST=MY_HOST
export POSTGRES_PORT=MY_PORT
export POSTGRES_DBNAME=MY_DB
```

<Callout>
This demo assumes the Postgres `vector` extension enabling `pgvector` is already installed. If not, the demo will fail when attempting to run the server.
</Callout>

Now the server is ready to run:



```bash filename="bash" copy
# cd $WORKDIR
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
python -m r2r.examples.servers.configurable_pipeline --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --config pgvector
```


### Executing a basic search

If the target database is empty, quickly populate it with demo files, which include `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.html`, and `.png` examples, using the command shown below. The `client_server_mode` flag specifies communication with an R2R server with the default URL of `http://localhost:8000`. To replicate the exact results shown below, these commands must be run in order on a clean database.

```bash filename="bash" copy
python -m r2r.examples.demo ingest_as_files --client_server_mode
```

Once the files are populated, run a search with the following command:

```bash filename="bash" copy
python -m r2r.examples.demo search --query="What is a fierce nerd?" --client_server_mode
```

### Executing a hybrid search

Executing a hybrid search is as simple as passing the correct flag to the REST application. To do so, run with the command below:

```python filename="bash" copy
python -m r2r.examples.demo search --query="What is a fierce nerd?" --client_server_mode  --do_hybrid_search
```

### Summary

The qualitative difference between the outputs of the basic search and the hybrid search lies in the depth and relevance of the results. The basic search primarily returns keyword-based matches, which can sometimes introduce biases, such as the up-weighting of specific terms like 'Fierce Nerds'. Hybrid search, on the other hand, integrates both keyword and semantic understanding, resulting in more contextually accurate and comprehensive results. This approach leverages the strengths of empirical keyword techniques refined over decades and the nuanced understanding provided by modern semantic methods, making it particularly powerful for complex queries.


### Extra - Explanation of the Hybrid Search Implementation
The hybrid search algorithm R2R implements in PostgreSQL combines the results of traditional keyword searches and semantic searches using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The process starts with two separate searches: a full-text search using ts_rank and websearch_to_tsquery, and a semantic search based on vector embeddings. Each document is ranked within its respective search method.

1. **Full-Text Search**:
   - Documents are ranked based on the relevance of their text to the query using PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities.
   - This involves creating a ranking index (`rank_ix`) for documents that match the search query text.

2. **Semantic Search**:
   - Documents are ranked based on their vector similarity to the query vector.
   - A ranking index (`rank_ix`) is created based on the distance between document vectors and the query vector.

3. **Combining Results with RRF**:
   - The algorithm merges the results of the full-text and semantic searches.
   - Using RRF, each document's final score is calculated by combining its reciprocal rank positions from both search methods.
   - The formula used is: `COALESCE(1.0 / (rrf_k + full_text.rank_ix), 0.0) * full_text_weight + COALESCE(1.0 / (rrf_k + semantic.rank_ix), 0.0) * semantic_weight`.
   - This combined score ensures that the final results are influenced by both the keyword relevance and the semantic similarity, providing a balanced and comprehensive search outcome.
