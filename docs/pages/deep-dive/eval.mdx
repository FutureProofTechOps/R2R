## Eval Pipeline

The Eval Pipeline is responsible for evaluating the quality of generated completions by comparing them against the query and context. It supports different evaluation providers and allows for flexible configuration of evaluation frequency.

## Eval Provider

The `EvalProvider` class represents a provider for evaluating completions. It supports different evaluation providers and allows for sampling evaluations based on a specified fraction.

### Initialization

The `EvalProvider` is initialized with the following parameters:
- `provider`: The name of the evaluation provider (e.g., "deepeval", "parea").
- `sampling_fraction` (optional): The fraction of evaluations to perform (default is 1.0, meaning all evaluations are performed).

### Evaluation

The `evaluate` method performs the evaluation of the query, context, and completion using the specified evaluation provider. It takes the following parameters:
- `query`: The input query.
- `context`: The context used for generating the completion.
- `completion`: The generated completion to be evaluated.

The method checks if a random value is less than the specified sampling fraction. If the condition is met, it calls the actual evaluation method of the provider and returns the result. If the condition is not met, it returns `None` (no evaluation performed).

## Basic Eval Pipeline

The `BasicEvalPipeline` is a simple implementation of the `EvalPipeline` abstract base class. It provides a straightforward way to perform evaluations using a specified evaluation provider and configuration.

### Initialization

The `BasicEvalPipeline` is initialized with the following parameters:
- `eval_config`: A dictionary containing the evaluation configuration, including the evaluation frequency and provider.
- `logging_connection` (optional): An instance of `LoggingDatabaseConnection` for logging.

The pipeline checks if the specified evaluation provider is supported (currently supports "deepeval" and "parea"). If the provider is "deepeval", it attempts to import the `DeepEvalProvider` and raises an import error if the package is not installed.

### Evaluation

The `evaluate` method performs the evaluation of the query, context, and completion using the specified evaluation provider. It is decorated with `@log_execution_to_db` to log the execution to the database.

## Using a Custom Eval Pipeline

To create a custom eval pipeline, you can subclass the `EvalPipeline` abstract base class and implement the necessary methods. Here's an example:

```python
from typing import Any, Optional
from r2r.core import EvalPipeline, LoggingDatabaseConnection, log_execution_to_db

class CustomEvalPipeline(EvalPipeline):
    def __init__(
        self,
        eval_config: dict,
        logging_connection: Optional[LoggingDatabaseConnection] = None,
        *args,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        frequency = eval_config["frequency"]
        super().__init__(frequency, logging_connection, *args, **kwargs)
        # Custom initialization logic

    @log_execution_to_db
    def evaluate(self, query: str, context: str, completion: str) -> Any:
        # Custom evaluation logic
        return {"score": 0.8, "metric": "custom_metric"}
```

In this example, the `CustomEvalPipeline` subclasses the `EvalPipeline` and implements the following:
- `__init__`: Performs custom initialization based on the `eval_config`.
- `evaluate`: Implements custom evaluation logic and returns the evaluation result.

## Passing the Custom Eval Pipeline to the Factory

To use the custom eval pipeline with the `E2EPipelineFactory`, you can pass it when creating the pipeline:

```python
from r2r.main import E2EPipelineFactory
from my_custom_pipeline import CustomEvalPipeline

app = E2EPipelineFactory.create_pipeline(
    config=config,
    eval_pipeline_impl=CustomEvalPipeline,
)
```

By passing the `CustomEvalPipeline` to the `create_pipeline` method using the `eval_pipeline_impl` parameter, the factory will use the custom pipeline instead of the default `BasicEvalPipeline`.

That's it! You now have a custom eval pipeline that demonstrates how to modify the evaluation logic and can be passed to the `E2EPipelineFactory` for use in the end-to-end pipeline.
