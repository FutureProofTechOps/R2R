## Telemetry

R2R utilizes telemetry that collects **anonymous** usage information.

Why? We use this information to help us understand how R2R is used so that we can prioritize work on new features and bug fixes, allowing us to improve R2R's performance and stability.

### Disabling Telemetry

To disable telemetry, set the environment variable `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` to `false`, `0`, or `f`. You can do this in your terminal before running your application:

```sh copy
export TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

With this setup, telemetry events will not be captured if telemetry is disabled, providing a way for users to control the logging of events.

### What do you collect?

We collect basic information such as:

- **Feature Usage**: Which features are being used and how often.


### Where is telemetry information stored?
We use [Posthog](https://posthog.com/) for our telemetry data.

Posthog is an open source platform for product analytics. Learn more about Posthog on [posthog.com](https://posthog.com/) or [github.com/posthog](https://github.com/posthog).
