# Simple Basic App

This example runs a basic application, which launches a server to handle ingestion, embedding, and RAG. Further, it demonstrates how to interact with the local server using the `R2RClient`.

```bash
# Launch the application
cd R2R && poetry run uvicorn r2r.examples.basic.app:app
```

This creates a default pipeline with settings defined in the `config.json`. It is the main entry point for the application. The logic is quite simple as we can see below:

```python
# r2r.examples.basic.app
from r2r.main import E2EPipelineFactory

app = E2EPipelineFactory.create_pipeline()
```

During the pipeline creation the `config.json` is loaded and passed to the pipeline. In addition to the options configured in `setup_config.sh{:bash}`, there `config.json` offers more detailed customization:

- Database provider
- LLM settings
- Embedding settings
- Parsing logic
- and more.

```json
{
  "database": {
    "vector_db_provider": "pg_vector",
    "collection_name": "demo-v1-test"
  },
  "embedding": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "dimension": 1536,
    "batch_size": 32
  },
  "language_model": {
    "model_name": "gpt-4-0125-preview",
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "top_k": 128,
    "max_tokens_to_sample": 1024,
    "do_stream": false
  },
  "text_splitter": {
    "chunk_size": 512,
    "chunk_overlap": 20
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "name": "r2r",
    "database": "demo_logs_v3"
  },
  "api": {
    "port": 8000,
    "host": "0.0.0.0"
  }
}
```

_Note: For a full list of options, see [Config Setup](../core_features/config.mdx)._

The pipeline is composed of three main components: `Ingestion`, `Embedding`, and `RAG` together with `Logging`.

```python
#factory.py

class E2EPipelineFactory:
    ...
    app = app_fn(
                ingestion_pipeline=ingst_pipeline,
                embedding_pipeline=embd_pipeline,
                rag_pipeline=cmpl_pipeline,
                logging_database=all_logging,
            )
```

To see what each of the functions does in a high level view, you can explore [Ingestion Pipeline](../core-features/ingestion_pipeline.mdx), [Embedding Pipeline](../core-features/embedding_pipeline.mdx), and [RAG Pipeline](../core-features/rag_pipeline.mdx).
