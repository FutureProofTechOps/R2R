# Running a RAG Pipeline Locally with R2R

## Step 1: Fork and Clone the R2R Basic RAG Template Repository

1. Navigate to the [R2R Basic RAG Template repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-basic-rag-template) on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
3. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/R2R-basic-rag-template.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd R2R-basic-rag-template
   ```

## Step 2: Configure the RAG Pipeline

1. Open the `config.json` file in a text editor.
2. Modify the configuration options according to your requirements. The `config.json` file allows you to specify settings such as the vector database provider, LLM settings, embedding settings, parsing logic, evaluation provider, and more.
3. Save the changes to the `config.json` file.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies and Run the Application

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```
4. The RAG pipeline endpoint will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Step 4: Interact with the RAG Pipeline

You can now interact with the locally deployed RAG pipeline using the R2R client or by sending HTTP requests to the endpoint.

## Step 5: Building Your Own Application

If you want to build your own application that interacts with the RAG pipeline, you can use the [APP Basic RAG Template repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/APP-basic-rag-template) as a starting point. This repository provides a template for building a web application that communicates with the RAG pipeline.

To use the template:

1. Fork the [APP Basic RAG Template repository](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/APP-basic-rag-template) on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Follow the instructions in the repository's README to set up and run the web application locally.
4. Customize the web application according to your needs, integrating it with your locally deployed RAG pipeline.

For more advanced usage and customization options, refer to the [R2R documentation](https://r2r.sciphi.ai).
