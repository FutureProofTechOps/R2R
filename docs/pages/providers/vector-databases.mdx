# Vector Databases

R2R provides a flexible and provider-agnostic approach to integrate with various vector databases for storing and retrieving vector embeddings. The framework includes built-in support for the following vector database providers:

- Local (SQLite)
- PGVector

## Toggling Between Vector DB Providers

To toggle between different vector database providers, you need to update the `vector_database` section of the configuration file (`config.json`). For example:

```json
"vector_database": {
    "provider": "local",
    "collection_name": "demo_vecs"
}
```

By changing the `provider` value to `"local"`, `"pgvector"` you can switch between the previously mentioned supported vector database providers.


## Local Implementation (SQLite)

The `LocalVectorDB` class is an implementation of the `VectorDBProvider` that uses SQLite as the underlying storage. It stores vector entries along with their metadata in a SQLite database.

Key features of the `LocalVectorDB` implementation:

- Initializes a SQLite database and creates a table for storing vector entries.
- Supports upserting vector entries with their associated metadata.
- Performs similarity search using cosine similarity calculation.
- Allows filtered deletion of entries based on metadata key-value pairs.
- Retrieves unique values for a specific metadata field.

## PGVector Implementation

The `PGVectorDB` class is an implementation of the `VectorDBProvider` that integrates with the PGVector library for storing and retrieving vector embeddings in a PostgreSQL database.

Key features of the `PGVectorDB` implementation:

- Connects to a PostgreSQL database using the provided connection details.
- Initializes a collection with the specified name and dimension.
- Supports upserting vector entries with their associated metadata.
- Performs similarity search using the PGVector library's query functionality.
- Allows filtered deletion of entries based on metadata key-value pairs.
- Retrieves unique values for a specific metadata field.

## Configuring Vector DB Providers

To configure a specific vector database provider, you need to set the appropriate environment variables and update the `vector_database` section of the configuration file (`config.json`).

### Local (SQLite)

- Set the `LOCAL_DB_PATH` environment variable to the desired path for the SQLite database file.

### PGVector

- Set the following environment variables with the appropriate values:
  - `POSTGRES_USER`: PostgreSQL database username
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: PostgreSQL database password
  - `POSTGRES_HOST`: PostgreSQL database host
  - `POSTGRES_PORT`: PostgreSQL database port
  - `POSTGRES_DBNAME`: PostgreSQL database name

Make sure to update the `vector_database` section of the configuration file (`config.json`) with the desired provider and any additional provider-specific settings.
