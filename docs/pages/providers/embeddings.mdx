# Embedding Model Configuration Guide

R2R aims to be provider agnostic and ships with built-in support for the following providers:

- OpenAI
- SentenceTransformers (local)

The R2R team is actively working to increase the scope of these offerings in time, in accordance to the priority in which new providers are requested.

## Available Models

Anything supported by OpenAI, such as:

### `text-embedding-3-small`

- **Use case**: Suitable for general-purpose embedding tasks with efficient processing. Ideal for applications where speed and cost are critical.
- **Dimensions**: `1536` - Indicates the size of the embedding vector.
- **Recommended batch size**: `32` - Optimal number of items to process in a single request for balancing performance and throughput.
- **Pricing**: Approximately 62,500 pages per dollar. High efficiency and cost-effective for large-scale applications.

### `text-embedding-3-large`

- **Use case**: Ideal for tasks requiring high-quality embeddings, such as semantic search or complex text similarity. Best for when the quality of the embedding is paramount.
- **Dimensions**: `4096`
- **Recommended batch size**: `16`
- **Pricing**: Approximately 9,615 pages per dollar. Offers superior performance at a higher cost.
