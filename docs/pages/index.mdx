R2R, short for RAG to Riches, provides the fastest and most feature-rich way for developers to deliver high-quality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to end users. The framework ships with a fully configurable and customizable REST API that includes user-level and document-level management as well as advanced RAG features.

## Why?

R2R was conceived to help developers bridge the gap between local LLM experimentation and serving a scalable, production-ready application. Built with powering a user-facing RAG application in mind, R2R provides adequate performance and features for most RAG use cases.

## Key Features

- **ðŸ”§ Build**: Effortlessly create and manage observable, high-performance RAG pipelines with our robust framework, including multimodal RAG, hybrid search, and the latest methods such as HyDE.
- **ðŸš€ Deploy**: Launch production-ready asynchronous RAG pipelines with seamless streaming capabilities. Begin serving users immediately with built-in user and document management features.
- **ðŸ§© Customize**: Easily tailor your pipeline using intuitive configuration files to meet your specific needs.
- **ðŸ”Œ Extend**: Enhance and extend your pipeline with custom code integrations to add new functionalities.
- **ðŸ¤– OSS**: Leverage a framework developed by the open-source community, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and ease of deployment.

## Demo(s)
The [R2R Demo](/getting-started/r2r-demo) provides a step-by-step guide to running the default R2R Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend. The demo ingests the provided documents and illustrates search and RAG functionality, logging, analytics, and document management.

## Getting Started

To get started with R2R, we recommend setting up the framework and following an initial example.

- [Quick Install](/getting-started/quick-install): Quick setup using `pip`.
- [R2R Demo](/getting-started/r2r-demo): A basic demo script designed to get you started with an R2R RAG application. 
- [R2R Client-Server](/cookbooks/client-server): An extension of the basic `R2R Demo` with client-server interactions.
- [Local RAG](/cookbooks/local-rag): A quick cookbook demonstration of how to run R2R with local LLMs.
- [Hybrid Search](/cookbooks/hybrid-search): A brief introduction to running hybrid search with R2R.
- [Reranking](/cookbooks/rerank-search): A short guide on how to apply reranking to R2R results.
