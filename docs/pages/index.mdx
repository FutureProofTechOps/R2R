R2R, short for RAG to Riches, is a Python framework designed for the rapid development of production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It offers the fastest and most efficient way to serve a RAG pipeline to end users. The framework is built around customizeable pipelines and a featureful FastAPI implementation.

## Why did we build this framework?

R2R was conceived bring local LLM experimentation into production-ready and scaleable solutions. R2R is to NextJS what LangChain/LlamaIndex are to React.

## Key Features

- **üöÄ Rapid Deployment**: Facilitates a smooth setup and development of production-ready RAG systems.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Flexible Standarization**: `Ingestion`, `Embedding`, `RAG`, and `Evaluation` with proper `Observability`.
- **üß© Easy to modify**: Provides a structure that can be extended to deploy your own custom pipelines.
- **üì¶ Versioning**: Ensures your work remains reproducible and traceable through version control.
- **üîå Extensibility**: Enables a quick and robust integration with various VectorDBs, LLMs and Embeddings Models.
- **ü§ñ OSS Driven**: Built for and by the OSS community, to help startups and enterprises to quickly build with RAG.
- **üìù Cloud Solution**: Serverless cloud deployment available through [SciPhi](https://app.sciphi.ai).

## Getting Started

To get started with R2R, we recommend setting up the framework and following an initial example.

- [Quick Install](/getting-started/quick-install): Quick setup using `pip`.
- [Basic example](/getting-started/basic-example): A basic example to get you started with R2R with a RAG pipeline in a server and a client to interact with it.
- [Customize Your Pipeline](/getting-started/customize-your-pipeline): A walkthrough of features for customizing your RAG pipeline.
- [End-to-End Workflow](/getting-started/end-to-end): A comprehensive from running a RAG pipeline locally to interacting with it using a basic web application.
