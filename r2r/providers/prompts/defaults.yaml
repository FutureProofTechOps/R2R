    -Goal-
    Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
    Given the text, extract up to {max_knowledge_triplets} entity-relation triplets.

    -Steps-
    1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
    - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
    - entity_type: Type of the entity
    - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
    Format each entity as ("entity"$$$$<entity_name>$$$$<entity_type>$$$$<entity_description>)

    2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
    For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
    - source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
    - target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
    - relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity
    - relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

    Format each relationship as ("relationship"$$$$<source_entity>$$$$<target_entity>$$$$<relation>$$$$<relationship_description>)

    3. When finished, output.

    ---Role---
    You are a helpful assistant responding to questions about data in the tables provided.

    ---Goal---
    Generate a response consisting of a list of key points that responds to the user's question, summarizing all relevant information in the input data tables.

    You should use the data provided in the data tables below as the primary context for generating the response.
    If you don't know the answer or if the input data tables do not contain sufficient information to provide an answer, just say so. Do not make anything up.

    Each key point in the response should have the following element:
    - Description: A comprehensive description of the point.
    - Importance Score: An integer score between 0-100 that indicates how important the point is in answering the user's question. An 'I don't know' type of response should have a score of 0.

    The response should be JSON formatted as follows:
    {{
        "points": [
            {{"description": "Description of point 1 [Data: Reports (report ids)]", "score": score_value}},
            {{"description": "Description of point 2 [Data: Reports (report ids)]", "score": score_value}}
        ]
    }}

    The response shall preserve the original meaning and use of modal verbs such as "shall", "may" or "will".

    Points supported by data should list the relevant reports as references as follows:
    "This is an example sentence supported by data references [Data: Reports (report ids)]"

    **Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference**. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

    For example:
    "Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (2, 7, 64, 46, 34, +more)]. He is also CEO of company X [Data: Reports (1, 3)]"

    where 1, 2, 3, 7, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data report in the provided tables.

    Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.

    ---Role---
    You are a helpful assistant responding to questions about a dataset by synthesizing perspectives from multiple analysts.

    ---Goal---
    Generate a response of the target length and format that responds to the user's question, summarize all the reports from multiple analysts who focused on different parts of the dataset.
    Note that the analysts' reports provided below are ranked in the **descending order of importance**.
    If you don't know the answer or if the provided reports do not contain sufficient information to provide an answer, just say so. Do not make anything up.
    The final response should remove all irrelevant information from the analysts' reports and merge the cleaned information into a comprehensive answer that provides explanations of all the key points and implications appropriate for the response length and format.
    Add sections and commentary to the response as appropriate for the length and format. Style the response in markdown.
    The response shall preserve the original meaning and use of modal verbs such as "shall", "may" or "will".
    The response should also preserve all the data references previously included in the analysts' reports, but do not mention the roles of multiple analysts in the analysis process.
    **Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference**. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.
