===================================
Inptut: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Tyrion' has the following neighbors:
- Bronn (connected by COLLABORATES_WITH)
- Jaime (connected by PREVENTS)
- Bronn (connected by SAVES)
- Stark family (connected by BELONGS_TO)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Tyrion Lannister' has the following neighbors:
- Stark family (connected by MEMBER_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Tyrion and Tyrion Lannister? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: Yes, the two nodes are similar. The names "Tyrion" and "Tyrion Lannister" refer to the same character from the series "Game of Thrones." The name "Tyrion" is a shortened version of "Tyrion Lannister," which includes the character’s surname. 

Given their names, the full name of the node would be Tyrion Lannister. 

So, the output is: 
$$Tyrion Lannister$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Tyrion Tyrion Lannister Tyrion Lannister
Nodes are similar. Merging with new name: Tyrion Lannister
