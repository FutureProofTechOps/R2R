        "description": "Lyanna Stark is depicted primarily through her connection to Rhaegar Targaryen. She was betrothed to Robert Baratheon, but was famously kidnapped by Rhaegar, which played a critical role in igniting Robert\u2019s Rebellion. Her kidnapping is a significant event that contributes to the overarching narrative of the series, with her name often associated with the conflict between the Starks and Targaryens. The aftermath of her abduction ultimately led to major political upheaval in Westeros, including the fall of the Targaryen dynasty. The chunks provided do not offer further details on Lyanna's character or her own actions, but her legacy is tied closely to the events surrounding her and the impact it had on key figures like Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark."
