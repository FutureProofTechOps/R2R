Comparing 'Tyrion' and 'Tyrion Lannister':
===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Tyrion' has the following neighbors:
- Bronn (connected by COLLABORATES_WITH)
- Jaime (connected by PREVENTS)
- Bronn (connected by SAVES)
- Stark family (connected by BELONGS_TO)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Tyrion Lannister' has the following neighbors:
- Stark family (connected by MEMBER_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Tyrion and Tyrion Lannister? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Tyrion' and 'Tyrion Lannister', are similar based on the following criteria:

1. **Name Similarity**: The first name 'Tyrion' is a shortened version of the full name 'Tyrion Lannister'. This indicates that they are effectively the same individual but referred to in different contexts (first name versus full name).

2. **Contextual Relation**: Both nodes refer to the same character from the same narrative universe, suggesting a strong contextual connection.

Given that the names are related and indicate the same character, we can ascertain their similarity despite different neighborhood structures.

The full name of the node, considering their names are Tyrion and Tyrion Lannister, is **Tyrion Lannister**.

Thus, the output is:  
$$<Tyrion Lannister>$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Tyrion  AND  Tyrion Lannister  ->  <Tyrion Lannister>
Nodes are similar. Merging with new name: <Tyrion Lannister>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparing 'Bran Stark' and 'Bran':
===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Bran Stark' has the following neighbors:
- Stark family (connected by MEMBER_OF)
- Stark family (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Bran' has the following neighbors:
- Starks (connected by IS_EMPLOYED_BY)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Bran Stark and Bran? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Bran Stark' and 'Bran', have names that are quite similar. 'Bran Stark' clearly includes the first name 'Bran', and 'Stark' as his last name, making it reasonable to consider them related. 'Bran' is essentially a shortened version of 'Bran Stark'. 

However, when examining their neighborhoods, there is a notable difference. 

- Node 1 (Bran Stark) is connected to family relationships, showing a deep familial connection to the Stark family, while 
- Node 2 (Bran) is connected to a business or employment relationship with 'Starks', which may not necessarily imply a familial connection.

Despite the differences in their neighborhoods, the names are closely related, and 'Bran' is an abbreviation of 'Bran Stark'.

Therefore, I would conclude that they are similar enough to be considered the same character but differing in the context of their relationships.

Thus, the full name for the node would be:
$$<NAME>$$ Bran Stark
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Bran Stark  AND  Bran  ->  <NAME>
Nodes are similar. Merging with new name: <NAME>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparing 'Bran Stark' and 'Brandon Stark':
===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Bran Stark' has the following neighbors:
- Stark family (connected by MEMBER_OF)
- Stark family (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Brandon Stark' has the following neighbors:
- Jaime Lannister (connected by AFFECTS)
- Red Keep (connected by LOCATED_IN)
- Ned (connected by SIBLING_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Bran Stark and Brandon Stark? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes 'Bran Stark' and 'Brandon Stark' are indeed similar. They share the same first name, with 'Bran' being a short form or nickname of 'Brandon'. This indicates that they are likely to refer to the same individual, especially within the context of the Stark family in the "Game of Thrones" universe. 

In terms of their neighborhoods:
- Node 1 indicates connections to the Stark family, which aligns with both characters being part of the Stark lineage.
- Node 2 includes connections to other important characters and locations, which, while different, still relates to the broader narrative involving the Stark family.

Thus, the names being connected as variations of each other strongly supports the idea of their similarity.

The full name of the node, given their names, would be: $$Brandon Stark$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Bran Stark  AND  Brandon Stark  ->  Brandon Stark
Nodes are similar. Merging with new name: Brandon Stark

Comparing 'Sansa Stark' and 'Sansa':
===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Sansa Stark' has the following neighbors:
- Starks (connected by PART_OF)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Sansa' has the following neighbors:
- Stark (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Sansa Stark and Sansa? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are similar. The names "Sansa Stark" and "Sansa" share a significant portion of their spelling and refer to the same character from "Game of Thrones." "Sansa" is a shortened version of "Sansa Stark," which is typically how she is referred to in full.

Considering both nodes contain references to "Stark," we can identify that they are indeed about the same character. The neighborhood structures reflect different relationships, but this does not detract from the similarity based on their names.

Thus, the full name would be $$Sansa Stark$$.
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Sansa Stark  AND  Sansa  ->  Sansa Stark
Nodes are similar. Merging with new name: Sansa Stark
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparing 'Ned Stark' and 'Ned':
===================================

- Robb Stark (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Jon Snow (connected by SIBLING_OF)
- Ned Stark's father (connected by CHILD_OF)
- The Starks (connected by OWNER_OF)
- Catelyn (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Jon Arryn (connected by ALLIES_WITH)
- Starks (connected by IS_EMPLOYED_BY)
- Catelyn (connected by ALLIES_WITH)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Ned' has the following neighbors:
- Aerys (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Jaime Lannister (connected by AFFECTS)
- Westerners (connected by MEMBER_OF)
- Westerners (connected by PART_OF)
- Aerys (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Brandon Stark (connected by SIBLING_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Ned Stark and Ned? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are similar because their names refer to the same character from the same universe, albeit with a slight difference in naming. "Ned Stark" is a full name, while "Ned" is a shortened version. Both names share the same first name, "Ned," and "Stark" is a common surname that indicates the character's family.

Their neighborhoods show different characters and connections, which indicates that they may represent different contexts or timelines, but the similarities in the names are enough to consider them as the same individual.

Given these reasons, the full name of the node is: $$Ned Stark$$.
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Ned Stark  AND  Ned  ->  Ned Stark

Comparing 'Ned Stark' and 'Ned Stark's father':
===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Ned Stark' has the following neighbors:
- Targaryens (connected by FOUNDED)
- Catelyn Tully (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Jon Arryn (connected by COLLABORATES_WITH)
- Robb Stark (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Jon Snow (connected by SIBLING_OF)

- Catelyn (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Jon Arryn (connected by ALLIES_WITH)
- Starks (connected by IS_EMPLOYED_BY)
- Catelyn (connected by ALLIES_WITH)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Ned Stark's father' has the following neighbors:
- Ned Stark (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Ned Stark and Ned Stark's father? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, "Ned Stark" and "Ned Stark's father," are similar in that they share a direct familial connection—"Ned Stark" is the child of "Ned Stark's father." Additionally, the names themselves are very closely related; they both contain "Ned Stark," with "Ned Stark's father" specifying the parental relationship. This similarity in the names can suggest a strong relational tie, which is further supported by the neighborhood structure of "Ned Stark's father" having "Ned Stark" as a neighbor through the "CHILD_OF" connection.

However, "Ned Stark's father" is explicitly a title referring to Ned Stark's parent, rather than being a standalone name like "Ned Stark." Therefore, we can't consider them fully identical; rather, they represent different levels in a family hierarchy.

Based on their names and connection, it could be concluded that they represent a direct parent-child relationship.

The full name of the node, given that their names are "Ned Stark" and "Ned Stark's father," would be $$Eddard Stark$$, since "Ned" is a nickname for Eddard Stark, commonly known as "Ned" in the series "Game of Thrones."

So, the output reflecting their similarity is:

$$Eddard Stark$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Ned Stark  AND  Ned Stark's father  ->  Eddard Stark
Nodes are similar. Merging with new name: Eddard Stark

===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Catelyn' has the following neighbors:
- Petyr Baelish (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Tywin Lannister (connected by PARENT_OF)
- Ned Stark (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Ned Stark (connected by ALLIES_WITH)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Catelyn Tully' has the following neighbors:
- Winterfels (connected by LIVES_IN)
- Ned Stark (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Eddard Stark (connected by MARRIED_TO)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Catelyn and Catelyn Tully? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes 'Catelyn' and 'Catelyn Tully' are indeed similar, primarily because they share the same first name "Catelyn." The last name "Tully" corresponds to Catelyn's family name, indicating her lineage, which also aligns with the common practice of naming in certain cultural contexts including that of "Game of Thrones." 

Furthermore, examining the neighborhoods, both nodes feature connections to 'Ned Stark', suggesting that they refer to the same character from the series. This further cements their similarity despite some differences in additional relationships presented in their respective neighborhoods.

Thus, combining the observations above, the full name of the node would be: $$Catelyn Tully$$.
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Catelyn  AND  Catelyn Tully  ->  Catelyn Tully

- Jon Arryn (connected by MARRIED_TO)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Catelyn and Catelyn Stark? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Catelyn' and 'Catelyn Stark', appear to reference the same character but with different name formats. 'Catelyn' is a shortened version of the character's name, while 'Catelyn Stark' includes her surname, which often provides additional specificity in literary contexts.

Though their neighborhoods differ significantly, pertaining to different relationships and connections, the similarity in names suggests they might refer to the same individual. The spelling is consistent and they are not widely abbreviated or altered. Thus, they can be seen as similar due to their naming.

Given that one name is a full form of the other, the full name for the node would be Catelyn Stark.

Comparing 'Aerys' and 'Aerys II Targaryen':
===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Aerys' has the following neighbors:
- Ned (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Red Keep's throne room (connected by PREDECESSOR_OF)
- Ned (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Jaime Lannister (connected by PREDECESSOR_OF)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Aerys II Targaryen' has the following neighbors:
- Targaryen (connected by PART_OF)
- Targaryen (connected by BELONGS_TO)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Aerys and Aerys II Targaryen? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes 'Aerys' and 'Aerys II Targaryen' are similar in that they share the same first name, "Aerys." The second node has a more formal title that specifies the lineage, as indicated by "II Targaryen." However, the neighborhoods of the two nodes showcase distinct relationships and contexts. 

Node 1, 'Aerys,' engages in various familial and hierarchical connections, particularly through marriage and direct lineage (Ned is both a spouse and a parent), while Node 2, 'Aerys II Targaryen,' relates to broader affiliations with the Targaryen family but lacks personal connections that denote individual relationships. 

Despite the differences in neighborhoods, the similarity in names is strong enough to consider these nodes as related. 

Given this, the full name of the node would be Aerys II Targaryen, reflecting both the name and the title.

Therefore, my answer is:
$$Aerys II Targaryen$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Aerys  AND  Aerys II Targaryen  ->  Aerys II Targaryen
Nodes are similar. Merging with new name: Aerys II Targaryen

Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Aerys' has the following neighbors:
- Ned (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Red Keep's throne room (connected by PREDECESSOR_OF)
- Ned (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Jaime Lannister (connected by PREDECESSOR_OF)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Aerys Targaryen' has the following neighbors:
- Brother of Daenerys and son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Khal Drogo (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Aerys and Aerys Targaryen? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Aerys' and 'Aerys Targaryen', have similar names, with 'Aerys Targaryen' being a more specific full name that includes the family name 'Targaryen'. However, the content and context of their neighborhoods differ significantly, indicating that they represent different characters and roles within a narrative.

Node 1 ('Aerys') has connections that suggest a role tied more to relationships and power dynamics (e.g., MARRIED_TO, CHILD_OF, PREDECESSOR_OF), possibly indicating a stately character, while Node 2 ('Aerys Targaryen') has connections that relate more to lineage and family (e.g., CHILD_OF) with specific familial references.

Considering both the names and neighborhoods, they represent the same character but in different contexts. Therefore, they can be seen as similar.

The full name of the node, given their names are Aerys and Aerys Targaryen, would be $$Aerys Targaryen$$.
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Aerys  AND  Aerys Targaryen  ->  Aerys Targaryen

Comparing 'Aerys' and 'Brother of Daenerys and son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen':
===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Aerys' has the following neighbors:
- Ned (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Red Keep's throne room (connected by PREDECESSOR_OF)
- Ned (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Jaime Lannister (connected by PREDECESSOR_OF)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Brother of Daenerys and son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen' has the following neighbors:
- Daenerys Targaryen (connected by SIBLING_OF)
- Aerys Targaryen (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Westeros (connected by LIVES_IN)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Aerys and Brother of Daenerys and son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are:

1. Node 'Aerys' - Represents a character with the name Aerys Targaryen.
2. Node 'Brother of Daenerys and son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen' - Refers to a character known as Viserys Targaryen, who is Daenerys Targaryen's brother and also the son of Aerys Targaryen.

In terms of similarity:

- Both names refer to members of the Targaryen family, specifically the family of Aerys Targaryen (commonly referred to as the "Mad King"). 
- The second node's name explicitly mentions the relationship to Aerys Targaryen, while the first node is simply named Aerys.
- The connection between them is evident as they share familial ties (father and son).

Given these points, we can conclude that they are similar due to the close familial relationship and the connection to the same royal lineage.

The full name of the second node could be identified as Viserys Targaryen.

Therefore, the output would be:
$$Viserys Targaryen$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Aerys  AND  Brother of Daenerys and son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen  ->  Viserys Targaryen

Comparing 'Aerys' and 'King Aerys Targaryen':
===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Aerys' has the following neighbors:
- Ned (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Red Keep's throne room (connected by PREDECESSOR_OF)
- Ned (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Jaime Lannister (connected by PREDECESSOR_OF)

    Node 2:
    Node 'King Aerys Targaryen' has the following neighbors:
- Khal Drogo (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Aerys and King Aerys Targaryen? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Aerys' and 'King Aerys Targaryen', share a common name component ("Aerys"), indicating a similarity. The full title of Node 2 suggests that 'King Aerys Targaryen' refers to a specific person, while 'Aerys' may be a shorthand or informal reference. 

However, the neighborhoods reveal a significant difference in their relationships: 'Aerys' has multiple connections including familial ties and political relationships, while 'King Aerys Targaryen' has only one connection. This indicates that while the names are similar (both refer to the same individual albeit in different contexts), the neighborhood structures and the context in which they are used differ considerably.

Given this analysis, I conclude that they are not similar because the context and relationships associated with each are significantly different, despite the similarity in names. 

Final output: $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Aerys  AND  King Aerys Targaryen  ->  NOT_SIMILAR
The nodes are not similar.

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Ser Gregor Cleagne and Gregor? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are not similar. 

While the names "Ser Gregor Cleagne" and "Gregor" share the first name "Gregor," the full name "Ser Gregor Cleagne" includes a title ("Ser") and a last name ("Cleagne"), whereas "Gregor" is a shorter, more informal name without any title or last name. Additionally, their neighborhood structures are quite different: Node 1 has neighbors connected by different relationships, such as "SIBLING_OF" and "CHILD_OF," while Node 2 has only one neighbor. The distinction in neighborhood connections further indicates that they represent different characters or roles within their respective contexts.

Thus, the final output is $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.

    Node 2:
    Node 'Brandon Stark' has the following neighbors:
- Jaime Lannister (connected by AFFECTS)
- Red Keep (connected by LOCATED_IN)
- Ned (connected by SIBLING_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Bran and Brandon Stark? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Bran' and 'Brandon Stark', are similar because 'Bran' is a commonly used shortened version of 'Brandon'. This aligns with the criteria of names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other.

Given that the full name of the node, given 'Bran' and 'Brandon Stark', is $$Brandon Stark$$.

Thus, the final output is:
$$Brandon Stark$$

Comparing 'Aerys II Targaryen' and 'Aerys Targaryen':
===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Aerys II Targaryen' has the following neighbors:
- Targaryen (connected by PART_OF)
- Targaryen (connected by BELONGS_TO)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Aerys Targaryen' has the following neighbors:
- Brother of Daenerys and son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Khal Drogo (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Aerys II Targaryen and Aerys Targaryen? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, Aerys II Targaryen and Aerys Targaryen, are indeed similar. 

1. **Name Analysis**: The names are similar in terms of spelling. "Aerys II Targaryen" includes a Roman numeral indicating this individual is the second of the name in the Targaryen dynasty, while "Aerys Targaryen" could refer to the same person without the numeral. The names can be seen as variations of each other, with "Aerys Targaryen" being a shortened version of "Aerys II Targaryen." 

2. **Context and Title**: Both refer to the same historical figure known commonly as the Mad King, who is a significant character in the lore of "Game of Thrones" and "A Song of Ice and Fire." The use of 'II' indicates lineage, but does not alter the fundamental identity of the person.

Given this analysis, the full name of the node, considering that both names refer to the same person, would be **Aerys II Targaryen**. 

Thus, the output is:
$$Aerys II Targaryen$$

    Node 'Cersei Lannister' has the following neighbors:
- Robert Baratheon (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Queen of the realm (connected by BELONGS_TO)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Cersei' has the following neighbors:
- Joffrey (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Jaime (connected by PARENT_OF)
- Jaime (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Prince Joffrey (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Cersei Lannister and Cersei? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes represent the same character from the series "Game of Thrones," namely Cersei Lannister. 

1. **Name Similarity**: 
   - Node 1 refers to her as 'Cersei Lannister' which is the character's full name.
   - Node 2 refers to her simply as 'Cersei', which is a common shortened version of her name. 

2. **Neighborhood Structures**: 
   - Node 1's neighbors and their connections focus on her marital relationship with Robert Baratheon and her status as part of the royal family.
   - Node 2 showcases her roles as a mother (to Joffrey) and her relationships with Jaime Lannister (both as a parent and spouse).

The use of the name 'Cersei' in Node 2 may suggest a more personal or informal context, while 'Cersei Lannister' emphasizes her noble title. Since both references relate to the same character and the names are similar, they can be considered similar based on the name alone.

Thus, despite possible differences in neighborhood structure, the core identity remains the same; therefore, they are indeed similar.

The full name of the node can be inferred as **Cersei Lannister**.

- Jon Arryn (connected by ALLIES_WITH)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Robert Baratheon and Robert? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Robert Baratheon' and 'Robert', are similar because their names refer to the same character from the "Game of Thrones" universe. The name 'Robert' is a shortened version of 'Robert Baratheon', which contains his full name. Additionally, it is common in literature and media for characters to be referred to by their first name in certain contexts, which adds to the similarity. 

Considering their names, they are indeed the same individual, which establishes their connection. 

Therefore, the full name of the node would be Robert Baratheon.

    Node 2:
    Node 'Aerys Targaryen' has the following neighbors:
- Brother of Daenerys and son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Khal Drogo (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Daenerys Targaryen and Aerys Targaryen? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are not similar. 

While both names share the surname "Targaryen," they represent different characters in the narrative. Daenerys Targaryen is the daughter of Aerys Targaryen, the "mad king," which creates a familial connection; however, the context of their relationships differs significantly in their respective neighborhoods. Daenerys has connections that include relationships based on parentage, collaboration with others, and marriage, while Aerys has limited neighborhood relationships, primarily concerning his children. 

The names themselves do not indicate they are different versions or shortened forms of each other; thus, they do not meet the criteria for similarity based on the spelling variations or contextual relationships. 

Final output: $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Aerys Targaryen' and 'Brother of Daenerys and son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen,' are not similar based on the provided criteria. 

While 'Aerys Targaryen' is a specific name that refers to a well-known character, the second node is a descriptive phrase that identifies a character in relation to others, specifically indicating familial connections and titles. The first node has a clear name, while the second node lacks a traditional name structure and instead serves as a lengthy descriptor.

In terms of neighbors, Node 1 has connections to relatives (Daenerys and Khal Drogo) but does not elaborate on its own familial title. Node 2 provides its own family connections and an additional connection to a location (Westeros), which further differentiates the two nodes.

Thus, they do not share a similar name structure or format.

    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are not similar. 

While the names "Aerys Targaryen" and "Viserys Targaryen" share the same surname and are both members of the Targaryen family, they are different in terms of their first names and significance within the narrative. There is no indication of spelling similarity or abbreviations between "Aerys" and "Viserys." 

Furthermore, the neighborhoods of the two nodes differ significantly; Node 1 has connections through familial relationships and marriages, while Node 2 has a connection through collaboration with another character. Hence, the context and structure surrounding these nodes emphasize their uniqueness.

The final output is: $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.

    Node 'King Aerys Targaryen' has the following neighbors:
- Khal Drogo (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Aerys Targaryen' and 'King Aerys Targaryen,' share a significant similarity in their names. Both names reference the same individual, who is the son of the murdered King Aerys Targaryen. The title "King" in the second name specifies the status, while the first name lacks this title but still represents the same character.

However, when considering their neighborhoods, the first node, 'Aerys Targaryen,' has additional connections: he is identified as a brother of Daenerys and a son of King Aerys Targaryen, along with a connection to Khal Drogo, whereas the second node only has a connection to Khal Drogo. Given that both nodes refer to the same person (Aerys Targaryen is commonly known as King Aerys Targaryen) and share a part of their name, we can conclude that they are similar.

Thus, the full name reflecting their titles and lineage would be $$King Aerys Targaryen$$.

    Node 'Westeros, the Sunflower Sea' has the following neighbors:
- Westeros (connected by PART_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Westeros and Westeros, the Sunflower Sea? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are similar because their names are directly related: "Westeros" is a part of "Westeros, the Sunflower Sea." The name of Node 2 (Westeros, the Sunflower Sea) contains the name of Node 1 (Westeros) and adds a descriptor, indicating that it is a specific area within the larger context of Westeros. 

They share a common root, and although the second node has additional context, this demonstrates a direct geographical or contextual relationship rather than a substantial difference. 

Thus, the full name of the node combining both would be: $$Westeros, the Sunflower Sea$$.

    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are not similar. 

While they share a connection through Aerys Targaryen, the names and roles of the nodes show significant differences. Node 1 is referring to a character who is both a sibling and a son, indicating a family relationship, whereas Node 2 refers strictly to a king with no familial title connection to Node 1. The neighborhoods also reflect a contrast in connections: Node 1 has multiple relationships (sibling, child, and location) while Node 2 only has one (child). 

Therefore, given the differences in relation and neighborhood structure, I will conclude that the nodes are not similar.

The final output is: $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.

    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: Yes, the two nodes are similar. The primary reason for their similarity is that both names refer to the same event, "Robert's Rebellion," with the second name being a more descriptive version that adds context by specifying "with warhammer on Trident River." This descriptive detail does not alter the fact that both nodes are centered around the same core event, thus they maintain a strong similarity in terms of naming.

Given their names, the full name of the node can be represented as: $$Robert's Rebellion$$.

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Robert's Rebellion with warhammer on Trident River and war? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are not similar. 

Node 1 refers specifically to "Robert's Rebellion with warhammer on Trident River," which is a detailed event title from a fictional narrative involving characters within a rebellion context. It relates to the intricate relationships and events surrounding the character Robert, suggesting a narrative or historical significance. 

Node 2, on the other hand, simply refers to "war," which is a broad, generic term that encompasses any armed conflict and does not relate specifically to any characters or narratives. The neighbor "Jaime Lannister" may imply a connection to a specific story, but it is still on a different thematic level than the detailed context presented in Node 1.

Considering both names and their neighborhood structures, the complexity and specificity of Node 1 contrast significantly with the vagueness of Node 2, leading to the conclusion that they are not similar.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are King of Westeros and king of Westeros? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'King of Westeros' and 'king of Westeros', have names that differ only in capitalization. This difference in case does not change the semantic meaning, suggesting they are quite similar in terms of spelling.

However, looking at the neighbors of the two nodes reveals a notable distinction:
- Node 1 has Robert Baratheon as a neighbor connected by SUCCESSOR_OF.
- Node 2 has Viserys as a neighbor connected by OWNER_OF.

The two neighbors represent different relationships within their respective contexts. Robert Baratheon is known historically as a successor to the throne, while Viserys is connected through ownership, reflecting different dynamics in their respective narratives. 

Thus, while the names themselves are almost identical in terms of spelling, the neighborhood structures indicate a significant difference in context.

Therefore, considering both names and their neighborhoods, the two nodes are not similar.

Final output: $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: King of Westeros  AND  king of Westeros  ->  NOT_SIMILAR

===================================
Input: 
    Compare the following two nodes and their neighborhoods:

    Node 1:
    Node 'Ned' has the following neighbors:
- Aerys (connected by MARRIED_TO)
- Jaime Lannister (connected by AFFECTS)
- Westerners (connected by MEMBER_OF)
- Westerners (connected by PART_OF)
- Aerys (connected by CHILD_OF)
- Brandon Stark (connected by SIBLING_OF)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Ned Stark's father' has the following neighbors:
- Ned Stark (connected by CHILD_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Ned and Ned Stark's father? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are not similar. 

While "Ned" and "Ned Stark's father" refer to related individuals in the same family (Ned Stark being the son of Ned Stark's father), they do not share a comparable name structure. "Ned" is a first name, while "Ned Stark's father" is a more complex description that does not correspond to a single name or title. The lack of similar spelling or abbreviations further emphasizes their differences. Additionally, the neighborhoods of these nodes do not overlap, as "Ned" has multiple connections, while "Ned Stark's father" has only one connection, showing a clear disparity in their network of relationships.

Thus, the final output is $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Ned  AND  Ned Stark's father  ->  NOT_SIMILAR

- Tyrion (connected by PREVENTS)
- Kingslayer (connected by SPEAKS)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Jaime Lannister and Jaime? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Jaime Lannister' and 'Jaime', are similar due to the fact that they share the first name "Jaime." The second node is a shortened version of the full name "Jaime Lannister." Additionally, 'Jaime Lannister' is a well-known character from the "Game of Thrones" series, and 'Jaime' is commonly used to refer to him informally or in contexts where the character's full name might not be necessary. 

However, the neighborhoods of the two nodes also differ significantly. Node 1 has rich connections to significant locations and characters, reflecting a broader narrative context, while Node 2 focuses more on personal relationships and actions related to Jaime, specifically involving his close ties with Cersei, including being a parent and married to her.

In conclusion, the two nodes are similar in that they refer to the same person but differ significantly in their contexts. The full name for the second node would be:

$$Jaime Lannister$$

    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Prince Joffrey and Prince Joff? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Prince Joffrey' and 'Prince Joff', are similar primarily due to their names. They share the same title "Prince" and are variations of the name "Joffrey", with "Joff" being a shortened version of "Joffrey". This resemblance in name indicates a close relationship between the two nodes.

However, the neighborhoods differ significantly. Node 1 has neighbors that are more related to family connections and social standings, while Node 2 has a more limited neighborhood reflecting a professional connection and a sibling relationship. 

Despite the differences in their neighborhoods, the similarity in their names makes them comparable. Based on the name 'Prince Joff', we can infer that the full name of the node is likely to be 'Prince Joffrey'.

Thus, the final output is: $$Prince Joffrey$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Prince Joffrey  AND  Prince Joff  ->  Prince Joffrey

    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Prince Joffrey and Joffrey? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes 'Prince Joffrey' and 'Joffrey' are indeed similar. The names are closely related: 'Prince Joffrey' includes a title that adds context to the character, while 'Joffrey' is a shortened version of the same name. In this context, it is clear that both refer to the same character from the "Game of Thrones" series, and the title "Prince" does not significantly change the identity of the individual.

Furthermore, both nodes share common neighbors, including Cersei and Robert, who are connected through the same relationships (CHILD_OF), indicating that they both relate to familial connections. The presence of these shared neighbors reinforces the similarity between the two nodes.

Given the relationship between the names, the full name of the node would be "Prince Joffrey Baratheon."

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Jon Snow and Jon Snow's mother? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Jon Snow' and 'Jon Snow's mother', can be considered similar based on the first criterion of name comparison. They share a portion of their names; 'Jon Snow' is part of 'Jon Snow's mother'. Additionally, one could argue that in a narrative context, they are directly related as parent and child.

However, when considering their neighborhoods, the structures are quite different. Node 1 ('Jon Snow') has a rich set of neighbors indicating various relationships (such as siblings, colleagues, and family connections), while Node 2 ('Jon Snow's mother') only has one neighbor, which is Jon Snow himself. This disparity suggests that they have different social structures.

Ultimately, while they have a close name relation, the neighborhood structures differ, prompting a cautious conclusion on their similarity. 

Given that the full name of the node is based on the relationships, 'Jon Snow' being the child of 'Jon Snow's mother', the full name for the node could be concluded as:

$$Jon Snow's mother$$

Final output: 
$$NOT_SIMILAR$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Jon Snow  AND  Jon Snow's mother  ->  NOT_SIMILAR

    Node 2:
    Node 'Winterfels' has the following neighbors:
- Catelyn Tully (connected by LIVES_IN)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Winterfell and Winterfels? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The names "Winterfell" and "Winterfels" are indeed very similar; they share a common prefix and have a minor spelling variation. While there are no significant differences in structure or meaning that would indicate one is an abbreviation or a title, the names closely resemble each other phonologically and orthographically.

However, when considering their neighborhoods, "Winterfell" has three neighbors with different relationships — including characters denoting employment and specialization — while "Winterfels" has only one neighbor with a "LIVES_IN" relationship. This disparity in neighborhood structure indicates that they represent different ideas or contexts.

Despite the similarity in names, their connections do not align or suggest they are comparable in terms of their social structures. Thus, they are ultimately not similar in context. 

Final output: $$NOT_SIMILAR$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Winterfell  AND  Winterfels  ->  NOT_SIMILAR

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Jeor Mormont and Jorah Mormont? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, Jeor Mormont and Jorah Mormont, share a very similar spelling in their names, with only the first letter differing. They both have the same last name "Mormont" and are connected to the Night's Watch, indicating a familial or thematic link within the story they belong to.

However, their neighborhoods differ significantly. Node 1 (Jeor Mormont) has a diverse set of neighbors related to various attributes and connections, including significant characters and entities in the narrative, while Node 2 (Jorah Mormont) has only one neighbor, "Westerners", which indicates a much narrower context.

While their names are indeed similar, the neighborhoods show a stark difference in complexity and relational connections. Hence, while you could argue some similarity based on the names, the overall context of their connections suggests they represent different aspects and roles within the narrative.

    Node 2:
    Node 'Commander' has the following neighbors:
- Commander Mormont (connected by PART_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Commander Mormont and Commander? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: Yes, the two nodes are similar. 

The names "Commander Mormont" and "Commander" share a common title, "Commander," indicating that they are both related to a rank or role within a similar context. Additionally, the name "Commander Mormont" includes the title "Commander" in a more specific form, suggesting that "Commander" in Node 2 may refer to the same individual in a more generalized context. Since the names contain a common component and the second name is a shortened or abbreviated form of the first, we can conclude their similarity.

Given the relationships, the full name of the node would be: $$Commander Mormont$$.

- Commander Mormont (connected by PART_OF)

    Node 2:
    Node 'Lord Commander' has the following neighbors:
- Barristan Selmy (connected by IS_EMPLOYED_BY)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Commander and Lord Commander? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Commander' and 'Lord Commander', have names that are quite similar due to their shared term "Commander," which indicates a rank of authority. The titles also suggest a hierarchical structure wherein "Lord Commander" is likely a more elevated title compared with "Commander."

However, the neighborhoods of the two nodes also reveal differences. Node 1 has a neighbor, Commander Mormont, who is associated with the title through a structural relationship marked as PART_OF, indicating a connection to a broader group or structure. On the other hand, Node 2's neighbor, Barristan Selmy, is connected through the relationship IS_EMPLOYED_BY, suggestive of a direct employment or service relationship, which denotes a different social or power dynamic.

Given the contexts of their connections, one could argue that both sets of relationships pertain to a military or leadership hierarchy, but the nature of these relationships is different. The presence of titles reinforces their similarities, but the underlying connections differ in context and meaning.

In conclusion, while there is a superficial similarity due to the shared word "Commander" and its implication of authority, the distinct relationships and contextual meanings suggest they are not fundamentally similar.

Final output: $$NOT_SIMILAR$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Commander  AND  Lord Commander  ->  NOT_SIMILAR

    Node 2:
    Node 'Samwell Tarly' has the following neighbors:
- Targaryen clan (connected by MEMBER_OF)

    Are these two nodes similar?

    If you are confident that names are almost the same, then ignore neighbourhood completely. Similarity could be measured by the following:
    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Sam and Samwell Tarly? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes, 'Sam' and 'Samwell Tarly,' represent characters who are closely related within the context of their world, particularly in the "Game of Thrones" series. The names are essentially different forms of the same character; "Sam" is a shorter version or nickname, whereas "Samwell Tarly" is the character's full name.

1. **Name Similarity**: The names "Sam" and "Samwell Tarly" bear a clear connection. "Sam" is a common short form or nickname derived from "Samwell." Therefore, in terms of name similarity, they are related.

2. **Neighborhoods**: Upon reviewing their neighbors, 'Sam' has connections to the Night's Watch and Jon Snow, hinting at a strong thematic environment associated with loyalty, brotherhood, and a military framework. Conversely, 'Samwell Tarly' has a connection to the Targaryen clan, indicating ties to noble heritage and power dynamics. While the neighbors differ, the thematic elements of identity and affiliation to significant groups remain consistent for both nodes.

Given that "Sam" is a shortened version of "Samwell," and both nodes relate to the same character's narrative context, we can conclude that they are similar.

Therefore, the final output will be:
$$<FULL_NAME: Samwell Tarly>$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Sam  AND  Samwell Tarly  ->  <FULL_NAME: Samwell Tarly>

    - Names are similar in terms of spelling or contain spelling mistakes
    - names that are shortened or abbreviated versions of each other
    - names that contain titles

    But if you're not sure, then consider both the names and the neighborhood structures.

    If yes, briefly explain why they are similar and then give what would be full name of the node, given their names are Ser Allister Thorne and Allister Thorne? $$<NAME>$$
    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: Yes, the two nodes are similar. The primary reason for this similarity is the names "Ser Allister Thorne" and "Allister Thorne," which share a common first and last name. The addition of the title "Ser" in the first node indicates a form of respect or nobility, but it does not change the fact that the core names are the same. 

Furthermore, the connections of both nodes to "Castle Black" and the presence of similar entities in their neighborhoods suggest they represent related characters or roles within the same universe. 

The full name of the node, considering both nodes represent the same character, would be $$Ser Allister Thorne$$.

    If no, briefly explain why they are not similar and then give a final output $$NOT_SIMILAR$$.
    
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Output: The two nodes are not similar. 

While both names contain "Targaryen," which indicates a shared lineage, they represent different individuals with distinct titles and roles in the narrative. "Viserys Targaryen" and "King Aerys Targaryen" refer to different characters and have different contexts in the story—Viserys is a surviving member of the Targaryen dynasty, while Aerys is the king known as the Mad King. Furthermore, the connections in their neighborhoods differ significantly: one collaborates with a knight (Barristan Selmy), while the other has a familial relationship with a warrior (Khal Drogo), which underscores their differing statuses and roles. 

Therefore, they do not fulfill the criteria for similarity outlined above.

Final output: $$NOT_SIMILAR$$
MERGING_STATUS_FOR_NODES: Viserys Targaryen  AND  King Aerys Targaryen  ->  NOT_SIMILAR
